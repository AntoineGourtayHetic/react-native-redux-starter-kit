# react-native-redux-starter-kit
A starter kit for building native apps using react

## Requirements
- Node.js (4.0 or newer)


## Stack
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for building native apps using react
- [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/index.html) a predictable state container for Javascript apps
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES6+ support
- [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) Immutable persistent data collections for Javascript which increase efficiency and simplicity
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) module loader and bundler



## Getting started

Just [clone](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/LeoLeBras/react-native-redux-starter-kit.git) the repo
and start :

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/LeoLeBras/react-native-redux-starter-kit.git myAwesomeApp
$ cd myAwesomeApp
$ npm i                         # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json
```

##### How to use ?

```shell
$ npm start                     # or: env DEBUG=true NODE_ENV=DEV react-native-webpack-server start
```

This will start a lightweight development server (webpack dev server) with live reloading.
Then open `App.xcodeproj` in Xcode, build and run the project.

##### How to build for production ?

```shell
$ npm run build                # or: env BABEL_ENV=production NODE_ENV=PROD react-native-webpack-server bundle
```
